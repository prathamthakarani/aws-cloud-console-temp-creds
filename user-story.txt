User Story for Admin Role:
Title: Admin Audit Log Access

Story:
As an Admin, I need to access and review the audit log of user actions within the Nest app to monitor user activities and ensure security.

Acceptance Criteria:

Login with admin user and password.
Admin access is different from other users.
In the "Audit Log" section, I can filter and view logs of user actions, including IAM access key creation, console access link generation, and deletion of both.
The logs provide information about the user who performed the action, the action type, and the timestamp.
I can filter logs by date, user, or action type to easily find the information I need.
The audit log is secure and tamper-proof to maintain the integrity of the data.
